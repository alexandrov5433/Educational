# About
'Cat Shelter' is a website/application for finding new owners for cats. It is a course assignment. Ready-to-use HTML and CSS files were given. The HTML was partly changed by my self. All JavaScript files are written by me. No framework was used for this projects server, only pure Node.js. 

# Supported functionality:
- site navigation through navigation bar and URL
- uploading of image files
- creating and saving new content (posts)
- searching through existing content with a search parameter (cat name or part of it - case insensitive)
- deleting existing content
- editing existing content
- two JSON files were used as a database

# Dependencies
Only the package 'formidable' v3.5.1 was used for processing incomming multipart/form-data. 
Please check package.json.
